# Keep But Penalty

**Keep your inventory. Pay a real death penalty.**

Keep But Penalty is a lightweight NeoForge mod for packs and servers that want to avoid item drops, grave recovery loops, or corpse runs without making death free.

When a player dies, the mod can keep their inventory, remove part of their vanilla experience, and damage equipped items.

## Default behavior

- Enables vanilla `keepInventory` when the server starts.
- Keeps one third of total vanilla experience after death.
- Removes two thirds of total vanilla experience after death.
- Applies 80 durability damage to selected equipped items.
- Includes armor, main hand, off hand, Curios slots, and Accessories slots by default.
- Allows items to reach 0 durability, so it pairs well with no-break mods such as Keep My Sword.
